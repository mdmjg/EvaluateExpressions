# Evaluate Expressions

## Instructions
Download the file into your machine and compile from its location by running `g++ -std=c++17 -g main.cpp`. 

Then, run `./a.out`.

The `main()` function will automatically run some tests and then ask you for input. You can choose to write input from the command line or write different test cases in a separate `.txt` file and then run `./a.out < input.txt` to process their input. An example of an `input.txt` file is also provided. Ensure each test case is in its own line.

The tests ran by the file were created manually, without external frameworks.
